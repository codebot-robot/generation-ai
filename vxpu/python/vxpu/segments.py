"""A graph split at its host ops, each dense segment compiled on its own.

A decode step of DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash is 26,000 small nodes with 42
places where the GPU must stop and wait for the host: the experts on
the CPU and the n-gram rows from a file (ops.py). Issued one node at a
time from Python the step is launch-bound; a CUDA graph would replay
the whole sequence at once, but a CUDA graph cannot contain host work,
and inductor's own partitioning did not keep these ops out of capture.

So the split is made here, explicitly: the exported GraphModule is cut
at every host-op node (torch.fx's split_module), the host ops stay
eager, and each dense segment between them is compiled separately (on
CUDA with CUDA graphs, one per segment). The segments are the same
boundaries an ahead-of-time compile (AOTInductor) or a runtime in
another language would use: segment, mailbox, segment.

The split is made from a graph already bound to the engine's caches:
split_module keeps every attribute read in the top-level graph, under
its original name, and passes the tensors to the segments as arguments.
The compiled segments need those addresses fixed, so the engine keeps
that one state bound and copies sessions in and out of it (Engine._bind)
rather than re-pointing the graph.

    next segment, and a CUDA graph will not capture a graph that mutates
    its inputs, so every segment after an expert call ran uncaptured.
    The rewrite is exact: the out-of-place op computes the same values,
    and later readers of the original tensor read the new one, as they
    would have read the mutated one. That holds only for readers of the
    tensor itself: a view of it taken before the in-place op would keep

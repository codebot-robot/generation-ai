# vXPU design: a database engine for LLMs

A database separates two levels of abstraction. The logical level is
what a query asks for: SQL says which rows and columns to return, not how
to find them. The physical level is how the database computes that:
which indexes to read, which join algorithm to use, in what order. The
optimizer chooses the physical plan, picking between candidates by
predicting their cost from statistics the database keeps about its
tables, and the executor runs it. When the data grows or the hardware
changes, the query stays the same. Only the physical plan changes.

vXPU does the same for LLMs. An LLM compiles once into its logical plan:
its computation as a graph (see [representation.md](representation.md)).
vXPU then chooses the physical plan for each machine: which device runs
each part of the graph, where each weight lives (GPU memory, RAM, local
SSD, another machine), and which kernel computes each op. Like a
database, it measures what it runs and feeds those statistics back into
the next choice.

The abstraction that makes this work is the mailbox. vXPU breaks an
LLM's execution graph into subgraphs. Each subgraph receives its inputs
in inboxes and writes its output to the mailbox of the next subgraph. A
subgraph might run on a GPU, the CPU or another machine; the mailbox
abstraction lets them intercommunicate and makes them interchangeable.
In databases, the Volcano model gave every operator the same interface,
and its exchange operator turned parallelism into a plan choice instead
of operator code. Mailboxes do the same for placement, so the planner
can put each subgraph wherever it costs least (§6).

This note describes the choices vXPU makes today and, section by section,
where the design is heading. A PR that changes the design updates this
note. The backlog of ideas lives in GitHub issues, linked from here.

## 1. The physical plan

An engine builds a physical plan when it loads an artifact
(`python/vxpu/plan.py`):

- **Hardware:** the device, the GPU and its memory, the CPU, SIMD level, RAM.
- **Choices:** compile and split the decode graph, where the experts live,
  whether to use the CPU kernels, and so on. Each records its value and
  where the value came from: a default, the environment, an argument.
- **Implementations:** every op the graphs call (`vxpu::moe_experts`,
  `vxpu::fp8_linear`, ...) has registered implementations in preference
  order, each with the devices it runs on, when it applies, and its
  numerics class: *bit-identical* to the model's own computation, or
  equal up to *rounding*. Ops dispatch through the plan, and the plan
  records what each input shape got.

The plan can be lowered into the decode graph (`lower.py`): each op call
becomes the selected implementation, its Triton kernels visible to the
compiler. Dense segments then compile ahead of time with AOTInductor
(`aoti.py`), cached per artifact, plan and machine.

**Direction.** The planner chooses between plans by cost. That needs a
model of the hardware (#349) and the engine's own statistics (§5), and in
the end it owns all placement (§4, §6; #316, #387).

The planner is part of the coordinator, and the coordinator is Go, next
to the router: it manages cloud machines and runs across the cluster,
and Go is the usual language for that. So the machine database the
planner reasons over moves to Go with it. That includes the hardware
model and machine catalog, which start in Python (`hardware.py`, #353).
The executors stay Python, where torch and the kernels are, and report
what they measure.

## 2. Models by name, and executors

A model is registered by name (`vxpu register REPO`). The router imports
its weights into modelstore, resolves the revision to a commit, and
compiles it in a Kubernetes Job running the executor image (`python -m
vxpu.compile`). The artifact is stored in modelstore under a tag naming
the commit and the executor image, so it was exported by exactly the
torch and forks the executors run. Clients then ask for the model by name.

Executors are of two kinds today:
- pods the router creates;
- external executors (a GPU VM, a Mac) running `python -m vxpu.server`,
  which the router dials.

Kubernetes keeps the bursty, CPU-only work: compile Jobs, modelstore, the
router. A machine that runs an executor is dedicated to it.

**Direction.**
- Executors and models become separate things: a pool of executors (VMs,
  pods), each holding several models, with placement in between, and each
  executor reporting per-model state (#385).
- An agent on each worker VM lets the engine manage machines directly:
  stage weights ahead of a load, serve them peer to peer, run the executor
  (#384).

## 3. Where weights live

Weights are content-addressed by sha256 at every tier:

| tier | what | code |
|---|---|---|
| bucket | modelstore's blobs (`gs://…/_blobs/<sha256>`) | modelstore |
| executor's disk | the local weight tier, filled from the bucket | `localblobs.py` |
| RAM, or memory-mapped from local SSD | expert banks and n-gram tables, outside the graphs | `engine.py` (`external_dir`) |
| GPU | dense weights; hot experts (§4) | `engine.py`, `experts_gpu.py` |

The tables a token reads a few rows of (the n-gram tables, ~200 GB on
DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash) stay on SSD and are read row by row, concurrently,
with no readahead.

**Direction.** Hierarchical placement: RAM as a cache over SSD when the
expert banks don't fit (#348, #259), and weight blocks shared across
processes on a machine (#322).

## 4. The experts

A mixture-of-experts layer's banks stay on the host. They are the
authoritative copy, and the CPU kernels compute any expert from them.
Expert use is skewed, so the hottest experts are also held on the GPUs,
one slot pool per GPU (`experts_gpu.py`). An expert op computes a token's
held pairs on the GPUs and the rest on the CPU at the same time. Because
weights are immutable, a GPU slot is a copy: dropping it costs nothing,
and no copy goes back.

Which experts are hot is a placement: chosen offline from the engine's
own statistics (§5) by `expert_stats --placement-gb`, as the hottest
experts across all layers that fit each GPU's budget. `expert_sim` replays
recorded traffic against placement policies before any is built: static,
decayed, informed by the prompt, and the oracle as a bound.

With `gpu_experts_moves`, the placement then follows the traffic
(`experts_gpu.Mover`). Each layer scores its experts by all traffic so far
mixed with the current request's own selections. At each request's
prefill it plans swaps of cold experts that outscore held ones, and a
worker copies them while the prefill computes. This is off by default:
on DeepSeek, the static placement already serves most pairs, and moves
during decode cost more than they saved.

**Direction.**
- A node can be in several places at once because its weights are
  immutable: experts on the CPU and a GPU, dense layers on both GPUs
  (#387).
- Experts on another machine, in another process that holds their banks
  (§6).
- Open question: who decides placement. A central planner can coordinate
  across a cluster of executor nodes, while an executor deciding locally
  responds far faster. A likely shape is both: the planner sets policy
  and budgets (what may be held where, how many moves may be in flight),
  and each executor reacts within them.

## 5. Statistics

The router records every request served by name: the generation's sizes
and timings, and the engine's execution telemetry (on every request by
default; every Nth with `--telemetry-every`). That
includes which experts each layer selected, and each segment's and host
op's time. Records are batched into modelstore (`vxpu-stats/<model>`, one
tag per day). `vxpu stats` summarizes them, and `expert_stats` and
`expert_sim` read them.

**Why.** A database keeps statistics about its tables (row counts, value
distributions) because its optimizer can only choose between plans by
predicting what each will cost. vXPU is building the same kind of
prediction system: given a model, a machine and a candidate plan, predict
the step time, the memory and the numerics. Statistics have two jobs.
They are its inputs: which experts real traffic selects, and how long
each segment and host op takes on each machine. They also check it: a
prediction for a plan that then ran can be compared with what it
measured.

**Direction.** The statistics feed the planner (§1): placement chosen
from measured traffic, and plans compared by predicted cost on a model of
the hardware (#349). Every plan that runs reports predicted next to
measured, so we can see how far the predictions are off.

## 6. Executing a step

A decode step's graph is split at its host ops, the calls that leave the
GPU: the routed experts, the n-gram lookups (`segments.py`). The dense
segments between them compile and replay in CUDA graphs. The host ops run
eagerly, called directly rather than through torch's dispatcher. Each
host op is where the GPU waits for the CPU, and where Python launches the
next segment.

The split step is also an explicit dataflow graph (`dataflow.py`,
`VXPU_DATAFLOW=1`):
- **nodes:** the segments (dense, experts, engram);
- **edges:** the tensors one segment passes to another;
- **resident tensors:** weights and caches, which never travel.

The reference runner gives every edge an inbox at its consumer's device,
allocated once at a fixed address, and fires a node when its inboxes are
full. A placement maps node names to devices; the host-op nodes can run
away from the engine's device. It computes exactly what the split module
computes.

**Direction: a dataflow executor with mailboxes (#372).**
- Every node is placed by the planner on a GPU, the CPU or another
  machine, with its inputs arriving through inboxes its producers write
  into.
- The routed experts are nodes too: a token's (token, k) pairs go to the
  experts' owners, and the replies are summed in a fixed order, so the
  result does not depend on who answered.
- On one machine, the whole step can be one CUDA graph: host ops become
  mailboxes the GPU waits on itself (a flag in pinned memory), with no
  Python in between.
- Across machines, the transport is RDMA verbs, with Soft-iWARP where
  there is no RDMA NIC, written once for both (#386). Today an expert
  server (`expert_server.py`, `VXPU_EXPERT_REMOTE`) answers a layer's
  messages over a length-prefixed TCP protocol from Python: the same
  message contents and error semantics, as a first step. It is
  bit-identical to the CPU here, at ~0.2-0.3 ms per remote layer call
  on loopback.
- Chains of mailboxes that traffic always takes compile as one unit
  (#387).
- The coordinator places subgraph nodes by name, on CPUs, GPUs, SSDs and
  nodes across a cluster, and wires up the mailboxes between them,
  across machines too.
- A node fires when all of its inputs have arrived. For a dense node that
  is a fixed set of inboxes. For an expert that is its own node, the
  messages per step vary (zero to n tokens, from one router or, with
  sessions batched, several), so "all" needs an end marker: every router
  feeding the layer has finished posting for the step, or a batch is full
  or a deadline passes. Until experts batch across sessions, one experts
  node per layer, with the owners behind it, avoids the question.
- The coordinator (the engine layer) shows the graphs as placed (which
  nodes are on which CPU, GPU, SSD or machine) with the traffic and
  latency through each node and mailbox. It builds this from the
  statistics the executors report. Only the coordinator sees across
  nodes and mailboxes; executors grow simpler about placement, carrying
  out what they are given and reporting what they measure. The telemetry
  already records most of it: each segment's and host op's time, and the
  experts each layer selected. The site is Go, served by the coordinator
  (#331).

## 7. Numerics

Every implementation declares whether it is bit-identical to the model's
own computation or equal up to rounding, and the selftest holds it to
that: token-exact against a reference, and with logits compared, for
every tiny model. Where a choice changes the result (an expert computed
on the GPU instead of the CPU rounds differently), that is a property of
the plan, recorded with every result the engine returns.

**Direction.** Sums whose order does not depend on placement (§6), so
that moving work between devices changes the speed and not the answer.
